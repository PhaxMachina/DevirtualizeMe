# DevirtualizeMe
Reverse Engineering Challenge ... originally created for naci's tool [Mergen](https://github.com/NaC-L/Mergen)
This tests your abilities against obfuscation through virtualization of code.

# Notes
- The challenge binary is hosted in the repository, named `CHALLENGE2_FINALLY.BIN`
- If you manage to devirtualize the binary, send me some of your outputs on discord `@terraphax`... if you manage to recover the bytecode, even that is cool, so send that too. Generic approaches are allowed (ex. Mergen)
